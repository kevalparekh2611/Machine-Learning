# Machine-learning-basics
Learning basics of ML with sample dataset IRIS 150 using some of the commonly used algorithms.

Implemented these algorithms to compare:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K â€“ Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Trees
5. Naive Bayes classifier (4 varients)

Building the model and predicting accuracy of every algorithm used.
